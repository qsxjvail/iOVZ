# Behind the Business of Bootcamps: Insights and Profitability

## A Week of Learning, Networking, and Growth

This week, I had the pleasure of hosting the **Tree Biz Bootcamp** in DFW, bringing together 18 attendees from across the country. The event kicked off with axe throwing and drinks on Wednesday night, followed by two full days of training, networking, and plenty of delicious food. It all culminated with a barbecue celebration at my house on Friday, which coincidentally was also my birthday.

It was a humbling experience to have people invest their time and money to attend this bootcamp. The responsibility of delivering value weighed heavily, and I worked tirelessly to ensure every attendee felt it was worth their investment. Feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive, with participants giving it an average rating of **9.2/10**.

## How the Bootcamp Came to Life

When we decided to expand **Fast Tree Care** to additional territories, I began drafting a training program for new operators. An offhand Twitter post about the idea sparked interest, and a few direct messages later, I realized there was demand for this kind of event. 

In just a week, we had a landing page, a Tweet, and our first attendees booked. And just like that, we were in business! 

### The Goals for Attendees:
1. Equip them with actionable startup skills.
2. Provide insights for those looking to buy or run a business.
3. Help attendees start their entrepreneurial journey or expand their current ventures.

I‚Äôm confident we delivered on all these goals. Here‚Äôs how the numbers played out.

## Lessons Learned and Future Plans

### Is This a Good Business Model?
Bootcamps can be incredibly profitable, but they‚Äôre also intensive and require significant planning and effort. For extroverts, the networking and teaching aspects might feel natural and rewarding. For introverts like me, the long hours of being ‚Äúon‚Äù can be draining, even with a fantastic group of attendees.

I‚Äôm exploring additional opportunities, including:
- **Paid Ads**: Promoting the virtual version of the bootcamp to sell the professionally recorded sessions.
- **Higher-Tier Offerings**: Testing $10k-$30k virtual programs paired with ongoing support.
- **Alternative Formats**: Offering 6-week virtual bootcamps with weekly sessions on topics like real estate or investing.

### How You Can Profit From This Model
Anyone can replicate this model by teaching what they know‚Äîor helping others package their expertise into a sellable format. 

For example:
1. Find someone with niche expertise (e.g., a dentist skilled at hiring).
2. Create a training program around that expertise.
3. Market the program to a targeted audience via ads or social media groups.

Split the revenue 50/50 and watch the profits roll in. The online education market is booming‚Äîworth $185 billion and growing fast‚Äîmaking it an ideal time to capitalize on this opportunity.
