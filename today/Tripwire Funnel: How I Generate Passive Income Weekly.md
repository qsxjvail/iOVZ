# Tripwire Funnel: How I Generate Passive Income Weekly

## What is a Tripwire Funnel?

A **tripwire funnel** is a powerful sales technique that offers a heavily discounted product or bundle for a limited time (usually 15-20 minutes) after someone signs up for your email list. It‚Äôs a no-brainer deal designed to appeal to anyone interested in your niche.

This method works well for various businesses, whether you‚Äôre a blogger, designer, or online shop owner. A tripwire funnel helps supplement your monthly income, builds trust with potential customers, and offsets business costs like ad spend or marketing tools.

## How I Use Tripwire Funnels to Generate Passive Income

I currently have a few tripwire funnels in place, and they consistently generate sales on autopilot. Every time I get a payment notification, I can‚Äôt help but celebrate!

For example, when someone opts into one of my Instagram-related freebies, they are redirected to a tripwire page offering my **Insta Phone Photography Guide** for just $7. A countdown timer at the top of the page reinforces the urgency of the limited-time offer.

### Key Features of a Tripwire Page:
- **Shortened Sales Page:** Highlight how your product adds value and solves a problem.
- **Urgency:** Add countdown timers to emphasize the time-sensitive nature of the offer.

## What Products Work Best for Tripwires?

Your tripwire product should be a stepping stone to higher-priced offerings. Smaller, digital products are often ideal for tripwires. Examples include:

- Plug-and-play templates
- Short eBooks or guides
- Video training sessions
- Printable art
- Journal pages

These products are affordable, easy to deliver, and offer quick value to your customers.
