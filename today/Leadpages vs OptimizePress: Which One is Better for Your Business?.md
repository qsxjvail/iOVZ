## Key Features of Leadpages

### Professionally Designed Templates
Leadpages offers a library of tested, high-converting templates that are optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. These templates allow you to create visually appealing landing pages that align with your brandâ€™s goals. Simply drag and drop elements to customize the layout and publish your pageâ€”no website or coding knowledge required.

### LeadBoxes: Dynamic Pop-Ups
Leadpagesâ€™ **LeadBoxes** feature enables you to create pop-ups that appear on your website, blog, or other digital properties. These pop-ups can be triggered by clicks, timers, or exit intent, making them an effective tool for capturing leads at the right moment. For example:
- A timer-triggered pop-up can display a special offer after a visitor spends a certain amount of time on your page.
