## Key Features of Leadpages

While Leadpages is widely known as a landing page builder, its extensive list of features makes it a powerful tool that can elevate your online business to new heights.

### Templates for High-Converting Landing Pages

One of the standout features of Leadpages is its collection of high-performing, tested templates.
