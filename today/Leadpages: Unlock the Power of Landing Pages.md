## Features of Leadpages

At its core, **Leadpages** is often seen as a landing page builder, but it offers far more. The software is packed with robust features designed to elevate your online business to the next level. Here's a breakdown of its key capabilities:

### Templates for Every Campaign

Leadpages comes with a library of **tested, high-converting templates**, ready to use for your campaigns. These templates are designed to minimize wasted clicks and maximize lead generation. Additionally, Leadpages provides mobile-friendly templates that ensure a seamless experience on any device. 

Customizing these templates is easy with the drag-and-drop editor, enabling you to adapt each design to your brand and goals without any coding knowledge. Even if you donâ€™t have a website, Leadpages empowers you to create professional landing pages quickly and efficiently.

### LeadBoxes for Better Conversions

One of Leadpagesâ€™ standout features is **LeadBoxes**â€”pop-ups that can be deployed across your digital assets, such as blogs or personal websites. LeadBoxes can be triggered by buttons, text, or images and configured for specific actions. 

For example:
- **Timed Pop-ups**: Display pop-ups after a visitor spends a specific amount of time on your page.

### Native Ad Creation

With Leadpages, you can create Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. This feature streamlines the ad creation process, saving time and optimizing your marketing efforts. Leadpages automatically pulls content from your landing page, allowing you to edit and launch effective ads effortlessly. Plus, a built-in Facebook pixel ensures you can track and retarget leads effectively.

### Built-in Split Testing

Split testing, or A/B testing, is essential for optimizing landing pages. Leadpages includes this feature, enabling users to test variations of their pages side by side. By comparing conversion rates, you can determine which design elements work best, driving better results for your campaigns.
